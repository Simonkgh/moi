    <h1>Dual-booting with EFI</h1>
    <aside>First published on: November 11, 2015</aside>
    
    <article>
    <p>Categories: <a href='/category/Linux/'>Linux</a></p>
      <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>I recently installed Fedora-23 on my machine - twice, on two different partitions. That gives me one to work with, and one to experiment with - and hopefully gives me an available environment to boot into if one of my experiments goes badly wrong.</p>

<p>Sadly, something immediately went badly wrong :-). Fedora, EFI and dual-booting is <em>not</em> a good combination. However setting things up correctly isn’t too hard - see below.</p>

<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>

<p>I’ve been using dual-booting for years on non-EFI systems - two (or sometimes three) Linux distributions installed concurrently on different partitions, with a shared partition for “/home”. This approach relied on each installation having its own grub binary and grub config-file. This is most easily achieved by <em>not</em> creating a separate boot partition, but instead leaving /boot as a normal directory in each installation’s root filesystem (yes, that does slightly increase the chance of damaging the grub setup itself).</p>

<p>The disk MBR then points to exactly one of these grub installations, ie that is the “master” grub install. The grub-mkconfig tool that generates the grub.cfg files does a good job of “probing” for kernels on other partitions, ie it is usually possible to boot into any install without problems.</p>

<p>When a new installation is done, that overwrites the MBR and becomes the “master”; running grub2-install or update-grub can manually select a “master” install. When performing OS updates that download a new kernel or similar, the grub.cfg for <em>that installation</em> is updated - ie does not mess with the grub.cfg for other installations.</p>

<p>There is a minor drawback that the “master” grub menus don’t boot into new kernels in other installations until something like “grub2-mkconfig” or “update-grub” is run in the master environment, but that’s acceptable for me.</p>

<h1 id="efi-dual-booting">EFI Dual-Booting</h1>

<p>In the new EFI world, things work a little differently. There is one EFI partition to hold the grub binary and config-file - ie having a different “/boot” directory for each install no longer separates the grub config-files. On install, Fedora creates directory “/boot/efi/EFI/fedora” (ie “/EFI/fedora” on the EFI partition) and puts shim, grub, and grub.cfg there. It then creates a symlink to the grub.cfg from “/etc/grub2-efi.cfg”. Installing Fedora on a different partition repeats the process, and creates its own symlink to the same location.</p>

<p>Finally, this new boot possibility is stored in the EFI firmware tables.</p>

<p>The symlink <code>/etc/grub2-efi.cfg</code> is used by fedora-specific tool “grubby” when <em>system updates</em> require updating of grub’s config - eg when a new kernel arrives. The results are ugly - both installations are trying to use the same grub.cfg file. And unlike “grub2-mkconfig”, “grubby” doesn’t regenerate a new/clean grub.cfg file but instead parses and modifies the existing one. When that existing one was generated by the <em>other install</em> then things are not likely to end well.</p>

<p>The solution is to instead create two <em>separate EFI boot environments</em>, which will act more like the non-EFI approach I described above. The necessary steps are:</p>

<pre><code># become root
su -

# copy the default boot environment
cd /boot/efi/EFI
cp -a fedora myinstall1

# set up link for grubby
rm /etc/grub2-efi.cfg
ln -s /boot/efi/EFI/myinstall1/grub.cfg /etc/grub2-efi.cfg

# regenerate a clean grub config-file for the current environment
# (writes via the symlink to /boot/efi/EFI/myinstall1/grub.cfg)
grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2-efi.cfg

# register the new boot-dir with EFI (and as side-effect make it the default)
efibootmgr --create --label myinstall1 --loader \\EFI\\myinstall1\\shim.efi
</code></pre>

<p>On reboot, the machine will now by default execute \EFI\myinstall1\shim.efi which runs grub from the same dir which uses the grub.cfg from the same dir.</p>

<p>There is some key-sequence that can be pressed immediately after boot (enter within 2 seconds on my machine), which will lead to a menu which then allows “alternate boot options” to be selected. The new entry (label=myinstall1) will be one of them.</p>

<p>Note that when booting into one environment, the grub menu will offer options to boot into kernels found on other partitions. However that information may not be up-to-date if the other install has downloaded a new kernel or similar. Personally, I think it would be nice if the “probing” option auto-detected other grub installs rather than just other kernels, and “chain-loaded” the target grub environment; that would ensure booting into the <em>latest</em> config for other partitions. However multibooting between multiple grub-enabled environments appears to be a low-priority use-case - multibooting into windows is probably the major one.</p>

<h1 id="broken-grub-os-probing-in-efi">Broken grub os-probing in EFI</h1>

<p>Sadly it appears that Grub generates broken grub.cfg files for multi-boot setups under EFI. When running in an EFI environment, menu-entries in the grub.cfg file need to use “linuxefi” to specify a kernel to execute, and “initrdefi” to specify an initrd/initramfs to load. This works for kernels in the host install, but the “os-probing” part that builds menu-entries for kernels on other disk partitions instead generates the traditional “linux” and “initrd” lines instead, and the menu-entry then generates error “unsupported command” when selected at boot-time.</p>

<p>This is being tracked via <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1173772">this fedora bugreport</a>.</p>

<h1 id="other-information">Other Information</h1>

<p>When EFI is enabled, the role previously performed by the code in the MBR is instead performed by firmware. Data stored in (permanent but editable) flash-memory defines the paths to all “bootable executables”, which must be stored on an EFI-formatted partition (basically, msdos-format) which the EFI firmware can read directly rather than the ugly disk-blocklists approach used by MBR code.</p>

<p>On a Linux install booted via EFI, directory <code>/sys/firmware/efi/efivars</code> has a file per “EFI variable”. The ones named “Boot*” define the boot values.</p>

<p>The EFI partition does not <em>have to be</em> to be mounted in the booted operating-system. However if not mounted, then of course any tools that want to update the grub binary or configuration-file won’t be able to do so. The EFI partition is therefore normally mounted at <code>/boot/efi</code>.</p>

<p>The operating system kernel and associated files normally goes into <code>/boot</code> - which might be on the OS root partition, or might be elsewhere. In pre-EFI days, it was common to have “/boot” be a separate partition but with EFI there is less reason to do so.</p>

<p>For technical reasons the “EFI boot options” don’t point direct to grub but instead to a <em>shim</em> program. EFI supports a “secure mode” in which it only boots programs if they have been <em>signed</em> by a key built in to the EFI firmware. Many manufacturers enable this by default, and ship only a few inbuilt keys - such as the one belonging to Microsoft. The workaround is to have a <em>signed shim</em> which then boots grub.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the “efibootmgr” application only works <em>after</em> the machine has been booted with EFI, which obviously can be tricky. The workaround is that EFI always supports a boot-option of “fallback.efi” which executes file “/EFI/BOOT/fallback.efi” and that in turn looks for files called BOOT.CSV and adds each entry to the list of boot-options. The standard grub-efi install process updates this BOOT.CSV file to add entries for the new grub-efi binary (note: file is in UTF-16 encoding). The “live install media” boots in EFI mode, so normally this work-around isn’t needed.</p>
